# Changelog

All notable changes to Doris MCP Server are recorded here. The product version
is defined in `doris_mcp_server/_version.py`. Changes after the latest tag stay
under **Unreleased** until a new version is selected and published.

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Added an explicit Dify 1.16.1 compatibility profile for MCP `2025-06-18`
  through the default-off `/mcp/legacy` endpoint, with initialize, stateless
  tool-discovery, and tool-call regression coverage.
- Added eight default-off MetricFlow consumer children to `doris_semantic`
  for exact-model discovery, status, metrics, group-bys, saved queries,
  dimension values, Doris SQL compilation, and bounded execution through the
  existing MCP Query runtime.
- Added a bounded `doris-mcp-metricflow/v1` sidecar contract and bilingual
  Doris 2.0+ version capability matrix.

### Changed

- Refreshed the locked authentication and development toolchain by upgrading
  Authlib to 1.6.12, Pytest to 9.0.3, and Black to 26.3.1, with the complete
  quality, test, protocol-conformance, and wheel-smoke gates rerun on the
  combined dependency graph.
- Expanded the stable public contract from 47 to 55 children while retaining
  the same eight top-level domains and progressive-disclosure budgets.
- Lowered the project-wide Doris baseline from 3.0.0 to 2.0.0 and moved
  version-dependent behavior into per-child release, runtime-probe, provider,
  route, and permission gates.
- Made ADBC an advanced default-off path that requires explicit end-user
  ADBC/Arrow Flight SQL intent and `explicit_adbc=true`; ordinary queries use
  `doris_query.execute_query`.

- Rebuilt the root English and Simplified Chinese READMEs as concise 1.0 entry
  points instead of mixing architecture, operations, integration, and release
  material in one document.
- Added a categorized bilingual documentation system for architecture,
  request flow, capabilities, protocol behavior, security, operations,
  configuration, Host integration, development, migration, and release
  guidance.
- Published the detailed 1.0 release record in
  [Issue #189](https://github.com/apache/doris-mcp-server/issues/189), including
  the complete 8-domain/55-child surface, capability detection, security,
  reliability, compatibility, migration, and verification boundaries.
- Added Simplified Chinese editions of the custom Tool Provider and Doris
  fine-grained access-control guides, and included the complete documentation
  tree in source distributions.

### Fixed

- Reaped MetricFlow sidecar processes before propagating request cancellation,
  and preserved the provider timeout error when the sidecar has already exited.
- Preserved fail-closed distribution provenance across version parsing,
  brandless FE/BE component fallback, and certification evidence validation,
  preventing unknown or mismatched brands from inheriting Apache Doris
  certification.
- Updated the locked Marshmallow and Virtualenv transitive dependencies to
  releases that address CVE-2025-68480 and symlink-based TOCTOU vulnerabilities
  in development-environment creation.
- Required at least two recorded time buckets before exposing or executing
  resource-growth analysis, so readable-but-empty audit and partition metadata
  no longer masquerade as historical evidence.
- Aligned `doris_cluster.list_active_tasks` capability detection with its
  read-only execution fallbacks, so restricted Doris accounts can use the
  `information_schema.active_queries` or process-list source when
  `SHOW PROC \"/current_queries\"` is unavailable. The public input schema now
  advertises only the query and compaction task types implemented by the
  runtime.
- Prevented MetricFlow sidecar processes from inheriting Doris credentials,
  bearer tokens, OAuth/JWT secrets, and unrelated MCP Server environment
  configuration by launching each provider with a fixed minimal environment.
- Accepted `+` revision metadata in exact Ossie and MetricFlow model
  references across binding loading, runtime lookup, and public Child schemas.
- Enforced the canonical read-only SQL allowlist again at the production
  connection boundary, including calls without an authentication context, and
  restricted internal session changes to an exact `USE`/`SWITCH`/profile
  allowlist. Doris administrative, export, load, plugin, credential, backup,
  restore, and other state-changing statements now fail closed before the
  database driver.
- Raised vulnerable runtime dependency floors and refreshed the lock file,
  including `aiohttp`, `aiomysql`, `cryptography`, `python-multipart`,
  `sqlparse`, `starlette`, and their affected transitive dependencies. Removed
  the unused `python-jose` and `fastapi` dependency chains.
- Bounded auxiliary OAuth and token-management POST bodies before form or JSON
  parsing, and stopped trusting spoofable forwarding headers for token
  management IP allowlists.
- Bound direct Compose service ports to loopback and changed the MCP service's
  default Doris identity from `root` to the dedicated `mcp_reader` account.
- Added explicit, mutually exclusive top-level domain boundaries and a
  single-domain discovery rule, preventing Hosts from speculatively expanding
  unrelated manifests for ambiguous operational questions. Unqualified cluster
  history requests now preserve every usable recorded series.
- Declared the exact `storage`, `query_volume`, and `user_activity` selectors
  for resource-growth analysis, including their recorded evidence sources, so
  Hosts reject ambiguous values before dispatching a Doris query.
- Kept resource-growth analysis callable in degraded mode when only audit-log
  history or partition-creation history is readable, instead of hiding every
  selector behind the audit-log capability probe.
- Updated JWT decoding type contracts for PyJWT 2.13 while preserving the
  existing signature, claim, audience, issuer, and unsafe-debug validation
  behavior.
- Documented the strict `/mcp` versus `/mcp/legacy` endpoint boundary in the
  protocol, Host, quick-start, deployment, troubleshooting, migration, and
  release guides without restoring pre-1.0 tool names or weakening security.
- Classified Doris runtime probe errors whose messages explicitly report
  denied access or missing privileges as permission failures, including Doris
  error 1105 responses, instead of exposing a generic probe failure.
- Replaced the Query Profile capability check that used a synthetic query ID
  with an owned, bounded profiled query and trace lookup, preventing valid Doris
  Profile APIs from being hidden by a false-negative probe.
- Added the Apache SkyWalking Eyes release gate, its bounded repository
  configuration, and the missing ASF license headers required for source
  release verification.
- Kept the fully available 12-child Semantic manifest below the 16 KiB
  progressive-disclosure budget by publishing only the child call signature;
  the Server still applies the complete validation schema at execution time.
- Added real Doris HTTP and stdio coverage for all eight MetricFlow consumer
  children, including compile-only behavior and guarded execution of compiled
  SQL through the standard Query runtime.
- Migrated the opt-in real Doris process integration suite from removed legacy
  tool names to the 1.0 hierarchical domain discovery and exact Child
  execution contract across Streamable HTTP and stdio.
- Added real Doris regression coverage for the Query read-only guard, runtime
  row, byte, and timeout ceilings, cancellation recovery, and database-level
  read permission denial through the formal `doris_query` Child surface.

## [1.0.0] - 2026-08-01

### Added

- MCP `2026-07-28` stateless protocol support on Streamable HTTP and stdio,
  with HTTP migration paths for `2025-06-18` and `2025-11-25`.
- Doris-backed OAuth with per-user Doris connection pools and operation gates.
- Client ID Metadata Document discovery for Doris-backed OAuth, including
  bounded retrieval, DNS pinning, cache-control handling, and consent-screen
  client/redirect host context.
- Per-request client capability enforcement, cache hints, typed protocol
  errors, and deterministic product identity.
- Permission-bound cursor pagination for resources, tools, and prompts on
  Streamable HTTP and stdio.
- HMAC-authenticated explicit state handles with principal, scope, resource,
  expiry, and shared-worker key binding instead of protocol-session state.
- W3C `traceparent`, `tracestate`, and `baggage` propagation from request
  `_meta`, with value-safe validation, credential-like baggage redaction,
  per-request isolation, and no trace metadata in model-facing results.
- Explicitly installed and allowlisted custom tool providers for existing
  business APIs, with lifecycle management, schema validation, safe audit
  metadata, and bounded process-local rate limits.
- Bounded query result streaming with deployment and absolute ceilings for
  rows, serialized bytes, and execution time, plus cancellation-safe database
  connection disposal.
- A read-only Cluster domain with eleven capability-gated children for node
  inventory, active tasks, metrics, memory, cache, compaction, workload and
  compute groups, recorded resource growth, and sanitized runtime evidence.
- A read-only Pipeline domain with five capability-gated children for
  ingestion status and diagnosis, materialized-view refresh state, recorded
  table freshness, and bounded upstream or downstream dependency evidence.
- A read-only Search domain with four capability-gated children for
  target-index-validated text, vector, and hybrid retrieval, Doris-native
  tokenizer previews, search-index inspection, and evidence-based diagnosis.
- A read-only Governance domain with eight capability-gated children for
  column quality, table storage, lineage capability and tracing, access
  patterns, audit events, user-defined functions, and authentication mappings.
- An explicit queryable lineage-provider contract and canonical Doris lineage
  event-store schema for companion-plugin deployments.
- A read-only Lakehouse domain with capability-gated external-catalog,
  lakehouse-table, snapshot, partition, pushdown, and Variant-shape
  inspection.
- An experimental read-only Semantic domain with four Apache Ossie Core
  grounding children, eight MetricFlow consumer children, revisioned
  model-summary resources, and explicit server-private Doris bindings.
- A fail-closed `doris_admin` architecture reservation that defines future
  high-risk action, scope, preview/execute, confirmation, idempotency, and
  rollback contracts without registering any management capability.
- Real Doris process tests covering Streamable HTTP and stdio.

### Changed

- Consolidated tools, resources, and prompts on the Python SDK v2 protocol
  core.
- Declared MCP `2026-07-28` protocol compatibility generally available on
  Streamable HTTP and stdio after the full release gate passed; the project
  package classification and documented deployment constraints remain
  unchanged.
- Restricted the modern `/mcp` endpoint to 2026-07-28 POST requests and moved
  legacy HTTP migration traffic to a default-off `/mcp/legacy` adapter.
- Unified package metadata, CLI output, `server/discover`, legacy
  `serverInfo`, and health endpoints on one product version source.
- Documented the modern request headers, migration steps, and deployment
  constraints.
- Recorded `subscriptions/listen` as intentionally unavailable until a real
  cross-worker Doris change-event source exists, with discovery kept
  capability-honest.
- Added bounded JSON Schema 2020-12 validation for tool definitions, arguments,
  and declared structured outputs without external reference fetching.
- Consolidated tool schemas, execution handlers, Doris OAuth policy, safe
  audit metadata, compatibility aliases, and generated documentation in one
  validated Tool Definition Registry.
- Separated immutable tool metadata into a standalone catalog while keeping
  lifecycle, authorization, audit, and execution routing in the tools manager.
- Positioned Dynamic Client Registration as a compatibility fallback behind
  preconfigured clients and Client ID Metadata Documents.
- Persisted static bearer tokens as self-describing SHA-256/SHA-512 digests,
  with atomic owner-only writes and one-way migration from legacy plaintext
  token files.
- Added coverage gates for the protocol, authentication, and core manager
  domains at 80%, alongside a 55% whole-repository floor.
- Separated production dependencies from test, lint, type-check, and build
  tooling across package metadata, generated requirements, Docker, and clean
  wheel verification.
- Selected Governance lineage providers deterministically from observed Doris
  versions and live plugin, store, and audit evidence: Doris 4.0.6 and later
  can use native companion-plugin events, while audit inference remains the
  primary path before 4.0.6 and an explicit degraded fallback afterward.
- Selected Lakehouse and Variant capability variants from observed Doris
  component versions and live metadata probes, with 4.1 lifecycle and
  advanced Variant facets reported separately from target-level evidence.
- Pinned Ossie model loading to the reviewed `0.2.0.dev0` schema, exact
  `model_ref` selection, bounded deterministic context construction, and
  route-aware Doris permission filtering without compiling or executing model
  expressions.
- Aligned semantic OAuth discovery, execution, resource exposure, and Doris
  OAuth scope issuance on explicit channel opt-in plus `semantic:read`.
- Rejected 1.0 configuration attempts to enable the reserved administration
  domain or disable its mandatory confirmation invariant.
- Enforced a 24 KiB hard budget for the stable eight-domain `tools/list`, with
  cross-domain and separate-worker determinism gates for Hosts that do not
  support dynamic tool re-registration.
- Added an evidence-backed Doris patch certification matrix keyed by normalized
  three-part versions, with complete Host-quadrant proof requirements and
  fail-closed runtime disclosure for unknown or mixed component versions;
  Doris `4.0.5` is the first certified target.
- Normalized all Doris capability, range, and certification decisions to
  `major.minor.patch`; RC, GA, commit, and deployment metadata remain evidence
  only and never create a separate support result.
- Published the 1.0 migration guide and release notes, and generated the exact
  8-domain/55-child tool catalog from the runtime catalog as a checked-in,
  CI-verified release artifact.

### Fixed

- Released failed capability-probe connections from their captured owner pools
  so a single-connection route cannot starve subsequent domain calls.
- Isolated Doris domain probe statements in independent route-aware connection
  contexts so one unsupported version-specific statement cannot poison later
  capability evidence.
- Kept Search filters, identifiers, vectors, and result fields structured and
  bounded, with caller values remaining driver-bound instead of accepting raw
  search SQL or Doris `SEARCH` DSL through the structured retrieval child.
- Classified missing Doris Search functions as unsupported capability evidence
  and preserved analyzer terms without colliding with credential-token
  redaction.
- Bound hybrid Search vector, text, and structured-filter parameters in exact
  SQL placeholder order.
- Kept Governance sampling, audit windows, lineage traversals, identifiers,
  and result collections bounded, and redacted raw SQL, client addresses,
  authentication rules, secrets, and error messages from model-facing output.
- Emitted lineage edges only from attributable native events or conservative
  direct-column audit evidence, without placeholder sources or invented
  numeric confidence scores.
- Kept catalog property values, storage locations, raw plans, and sampled
  Variant values out of model-facing output while bounding object, snapshot,
  partition, path, and type-shape evidence.
- Kept semantic discovery, resources, summaries, mappings, metrics, and
  relationships fail-closed when a configured route, binding, physical
  dependency, or Doris permission cannot be verified.
- Preserved configured Governance and Lakehouse runtime limits across the
  multi-worker parent-to-worker environment handoff.
- Preserved configured semantic loader, context, and OAuth exposure limits
  across the multi-worker parent-to-worker environment handoff.
- Excluded explicitly dead Doris components from active version gating while
  preserving them in node inventory, and kept live runtime manifests within
  the 16 KiB domain budget.
- Limited public detected-version evidence to each child's actual Doris
  component scope, preventing real Cluster manifests from overflowing the
  16 KiB budget and breaking Flat-mode `tools/list`.
- Preserved service availability after malformed requests, unknown methods,
  header mismatches, unsupported versions, and missing capabilities.
- Kept static-token Doris pools usable after repeated query timeouts, and
  stopped per-request token validation from mutating the shared global pool.
- Stopped list operations from converting Doris, permission, or internal
  failures into successful empty resource, tool, or prompt collections.
- Corrected resource and prompt error semantics and tool `isError` results.
- Removed admin-token query authentication and dashboard URL propagation;
  management endpoints now accept admin credentials only in headers.
- Removed shipped static credentials and the legacy default secret; static and
  management token modes now require explicit high-entropy credentials.
- Refused unauthenticated HTTP startup on non-loopback bind addresses unless
  the operator sets an explicit dangerous override.
- Normalized bearer credentials once at the MCP authentication boundary and
  passed the same redacted DTO to static token, JWT, external OAuth, and Doris
  OAuth providers.
- Required external OAuth access tokens to pass trusted RFC 7662
  issuer/resource/audience, lifetime, and scope validation before userinfo is
  used.
- Preserved external OAuth token failures through the authentication boundary
  and returned RFC 6750/RFC 9728 Bearer challenges, protected-resource
  metadata, and operation-specific insufficient-scope responses.
- Enforced exact external OAuth scopes across tool, resource, and Prompt
  operations before modern HTTP dispatch while preserving static token, JWT,
  anonymous loopback, and local stdio behavior.
- Bound Doris OAuth access tokens to the canonical MCP resource and rejected
  tokens issued for any other resource before per-user pool access.
- Rejected Doris OAuth authorization-code exchanges whose required RFC 8707
  `resource` is missing or differs from the authorization grant.
- Required Doris OAuth DCR clients to declare a persisted `application_type`
  and enforced type-matched redirect URI rules for native and web clients.
- Added RFC 9207 `iss` identification to Doris OAuth authorization success and
  redirectable error responses, with matching discovery metadata.
- Released Doris connections on SQL profile, data freshness, and access
  analysis paths.
- Improved Doris 4 role metadata compatibility and query recovery behavior.
